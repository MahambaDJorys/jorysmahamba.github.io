I had to create a web portfolio for myself regarding my wish to pursue graduate education in the US. I took it as a personnal challenge and opportunity to lear something new, ie HTML & CSS. Thanks to SuperSimple.dev for his introductory course freely available on YT!

I used ChatGPT for the template and to clean my code. I do not want to become a web developper after all so I did not ented to use my time making my website perfect all by myself. But now, the goal is achieved: I'm efficient in HTML & CSS and my portoflio is done.

If you read this, thanks for the consideration you're having towards my profile. Have a great time getting to know me a bit by exploring my website!
